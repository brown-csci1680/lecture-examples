# Channels demo

This code example demonstrates how to use channels to signal a thread
to wake up.

For the code, and an explanation of how it works, see the file
`cmd/channels-demo/main.go`.  For a video demo of what is happening,
see Lecture 04 recording.

You can run the example by running `make` from this directory.
